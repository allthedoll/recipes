# Crustless quiche

## Ingredients

12 eggs (sometimes I do more whites than yolks)
fresh basil, choppede
red onion, sliced or diced
balsamic vinegar (white if you have it)
tomato, sliced
feta, crumbled
salt and pepper
oil spray

## Directions

- Whip air into eggs by hand
- Add salt and pepper and a drizzle of balsamic
- Add feta, basil, and onion (I really don't measure this recipe, so whatever looks good)
- Spray pie dish with oil (or other dish, whatever)
- Pour egg mix into dish
- Bake for like 30 minutes on 350 or so -- until it is starting to set but not set
- When the egg mix isn't liquidy but not set, add slices of tomatoes to the top -- you do this later to make it pretty and so the tomato doesn't sink into the egg
- Continue baking until it looks done but isn't browning, 5-10 minutes?

I make this in different ways with different ingredients, like mushroom and spinach, etc. It's usually requested at family holiday brunches. You can also do this into muffin tins for quick breakfasts because those size will freeze well.
