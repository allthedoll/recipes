# Vegetarian chili

## Ingredients

1 can white beans (cannellini or similar), rinsed
1 can red beans (kidney or similar), rinsed
* you could do a can of black beans too, if desired
* you could add a bag of ground "meat" too, if desired
1 medium yellow or white onion, diced
3 medium cloves of garlic, diced
1 can tomatos (peeled whole, diced, etc. it doesn't really matter imho, just chop the whole tomatos with a spatula while you stir)
1 small can of tomato paste (or if you have a tube, about 1/4c)
Herbs to taste: chili powder, cumin, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper
~3 cups (380g) butternut squash or sweet potato, cut into 1/2-inch cubes  (I thaw a frozen bag)
2 1/2 cups (592ml) low-sodium vegetable broth
1/2 cup (75g) frozen corn (I like to brown it in butter first for extra flavor)
salt and pepper to taste
~2 tbsp olive oil
butter (optional)

**Optional toppings:** cilantro, pepper, greek yogurt, lime, shredded cheese, avocado, shredded carrots, smokey hot sauce, jalape√±o, etc.

## Directions

- In medium-to-large pot saute onion in ~2 tbsp oil until translucent; add garlic and saute for a minute or two
- Add ground "meat" to onion, if desired, and cook until less frozen
- Brown corn in butter in a small pan (if desired)
- Dump all the ingredients into the pot
- If you used whole tomatos, chop them up a bit with a spatula
- Let cook on low boil for like 30-45 minutes or you could proabably do this in a crock pot on low
- Adjust seasoning and liquid levels for personal preference

I like to serve this with corn bread and if I've made it extra spicy I'll top with greek yogurt and lime.
